Implementing search algorithms in llvm ir

Mostly using as an exercise to start learning llvm ir

Working algorithms:
    Linear search
    Binary search

src/main.ll
    These are the search algorithms implemented in llvm ir

src/utils.h
src/utils.c
    Utility functions I don't want to have to work out how to write in llvm ir

pyhton/make_data.py
    Create a list of sorted random ints and write to a file 'data' as space separated values
